        <h1 class="heading">Importance of Making Postive Choices</h1>
        <h3 class="text overcome">Making positive choices in today's world is vital, as often we tend to make choices that have a negative impact on us and get faced with the consequences. Being happy about who you are leads to us making positive choices. When others put their unwanted input towards us we tend to get indecisive and get pressured to make a decision we don't want to make. Thinking before you act is a must since each decision matters, it's important to pause and think about the impact your decision or action will have on yourself and others. Weigh the potential consequences of each decision, including positive or negative outcomes that may occur immediately or in the future. Our decisions/choices will either have a positive or negative impact on us or others so always make sure you think thoroughly before you act. </h3>
