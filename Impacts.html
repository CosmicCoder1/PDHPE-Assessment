        <h2 class="sub-heading">Positive Sense of Self</h2>
        <h3 class="text overcome">Developing a positive sense of self comes with self esteem, stress management and confidence. Through these factors we further act upon our decisions or actions. When we have a positive self sense we tend to take healthy risks to push ourselves to the best of our abilities. Having confidence helps us to bounce back from setbacks and encourages us to have positive interactions with others. When we have a positive sense of self we are less likely to become victims of negative peer influence or experience stress and we also have opportunities with our academics and career aspirations. </h3>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Negative Sense of Self</h2>
        <h3 class="text overcome">A negative sense of self can be caused by many different things such as the media, issues with relationships or peer pressure/bullying. Using the media as an example, as a teen is exposed to it, they try to change themselves â€“ they make themselves look and think like the people they have seen in the media. This can lead to teens constantly becoming stressed and worried about themselves. Which leads to poor decision making from the individual. The teen will make decisions based on what others think, not what they think.</h3>
