                <h2 class="sub-heading">Teenagers are risky, irresponsible and ignorant</h2>
                <h3 class="text text-stereotype">It is believed that teenagers are ignorant, i.e., they ignore what their parents and teachers say and aren’t concerned about others and the impacts of their actions. They are also believed to skip school, break the rules and become bad influences to the people around them.</h3>
                <h3 class="text text-stereotype"><strong class="bold">The Truth:</strong> Teenagers are responsible and listen to people. Many teenagers are leaders within schools and communities and they listen to the people around them in order to make decisions based on what everyone wants/needs. Many teenagers are also older siblings and are trusted to look after them and be a positive influence. </h3>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Teenagers are always on social media which leads to getting bad grades</h2>
            <h3 class="text text-stereotype">It is a misconception that teenagers are always on their phones and looking through social media. This has led to the belief that teenagers don’t spend their time doing much else (like studying). Another misconception is that teenagers get bad grades. Together, this has created the belief that social media causes teenagers to get bad grades.</h3>
            <h3 class="text text-stereotype"><strong class="bold">The Truth:</strong> Teenagers don’t spend as much time on social media as they are believed to. In fact, many teenagers spend their time taking up passions and doing things that interest them.  As further proof, researchers have found that there is no connection between use of social media and grades.</h3>
