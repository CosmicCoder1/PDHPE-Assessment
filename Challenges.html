        <h1 class="heading">How can Teenagers Overcome these Stereotypes?</h1>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Open and Non-Judgemental Conversations</h2>
        <h3 class="text">With open and non judgemental conversations, the listeners are fully able to understand where you are coming from and the point you are trying to get across. These conversations can prevent any misunderstandings and problems that may arise.</h3>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Self-awareness</h2>
        <h3 class="text">Having self awareness gives us power to influence outcomes, helps us become better decision makers and gives us more self confidence. When we have self awareness we are able to understand our strengths and weaknesses which helps us to set goals for ourselves. </h3>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Confidence and Self Expression</h2>
        <h3 class="text">Self expression allows us to relate to others, empathise with their experiences and build meaningful relationships. Being confident helps us feel ready for life experiences and in difficult scenarios. When we are confident we are more likely to move forward with people and opportunities. </h3>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Seeking for Help/Support</h2>
        <h3 class="text">Admitting you need help and asking for it is what keeps you strong and helps you rise up to whatever challenge you are facing. It helps us to calm and comfort ourselves when we're upset, to cope with the losses, changes, fears and uncertainties in life</h3>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Develop Resilience</h2>
        <h3 class="text">We all face hardships at some point in life. But those who develop resilience can tap into their strengths and support systems. When you have resilience you harness the inner strength that helps you rebound from a setback or challenge. </h3>
